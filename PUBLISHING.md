# Publishing Guide for Local LLM Kit

This document explains how to publish new versions of Local LLM Kit to PyPI.

## Prerequisites

Before publishing a new version, you need to set up the following:

1. A PyPI account
2. GitHub repository secrets for CI/CD

## Setting up PyPI Secrets in GitHub

To enable automated publishing to PyPI via GitHub Actions, you need to add your PyPI credentials as secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" 
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click the "New repository secret" button
5. Add the following secrets:
   - Name: `PYPI_USERNAME` 
   - Value: Your PyPI username
6. Add another secret:
   - Name: `PYPI_PASSWORD`
   - Value: Your PyPI token (create one at https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/)

## Version Update Process

1. Update the version number in `local_llm_kit/__init__.py`
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md file with the changes
3. Commit and push your changes
4. Create a new release on GitHub:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Releases"
   - Click "Create a new release"
   - Enter the tag version (e.g., `v0.1.1`)
   - Add release notes
   - Click "Publish release"

Once the release is published, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and publish the package to PyPI.

## Manual Publishing

If you need to publish manually:

```bash
# Install build tools
pip install build twine

# Build the package
python -m build

# Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

## Documentation Update

After a new release, the documentation will be automatically updated on GitHub Pages by the workflow.

## Troubleshooting

If the automated publishing fails, check:

1. The GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
2. That your PyPI token has not expired
3. That the version number in `__init__.py` is correct and has not been used before
